# LIRI-NODE

## Requirements

* Create an application called LIRI that takes in command line arguments and makes axios calls to popular API's
* Allow LIRI to specifically determine what call needs to be made by developing functions for handling each request
* Have LIRI make API calls based on the contents of a text file

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Javascript
* Axios
* Spotify API
* OMDB API
* Bands in Town API

## Brief Explanation

The command line arguments are stored in variables and passed into the API requests. The returned object is then dissected and only the pertinent information for each is printed to the terminal. The text file attached is referenced and the information within is parsed to make a more intelligent call to an API based on the first argument being made.
